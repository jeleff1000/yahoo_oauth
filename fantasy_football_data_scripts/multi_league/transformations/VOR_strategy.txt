🔥 KMFFL Universal Value Framework (Final Logic Document)

A unified metric system for Drafts, Waivers, and Trades across Auction, Snake, FAAB, and Priority leagues.
All metrics backward-looking but also usable in real-time.

0. GLOBAL FOUNDATIONS

These rules apply to every metric in Drafts, Waivers, Trades.

0.1 Replacement Level (the backbone of all value metrics)
Why replacement?

Fantasy value is not “how many points a player scored,” but “how many points he scored above what a freely available alternative would give you.”

Replacement Level Definition

For each league_id × year × position:

Let
➤ T = number of fantasy teams
➤ S_pos = number of required starters at that position
➤ N_pos = T × S_pos

For each week, sort all NFL players (not fantasy-rostered — full NFL data!) by fantasy_points.

Weekly replacement value =
average of NFL Rank N_pos and N_pos+1 at that position.

Season replacement PPG for that position =
mean of weekly replacement points.

Replacement points for a player-season =

rep_points = rep_season_ppg × games_started

Key properties

Scales properly to ANY league size & roster format

Position scarcity is automatically reflected

Uses your full 1999-present NFL dataset

Works with mid-season windows (“rest of season”) by recomputing rep_ppg over the same weeks

0.2 Primary Player Value Metrics

These become the “currency” used everywhere:

1. Season PPG
season_ppg = season_points / season_games_started

2. SPAR = Season Points Above Replacement
SPAR = season_points – (rep_season_ppg × season_games_started)


This is your main draft/waiver/trade metric.

3. PGVOR = Per Game Value Over Replacement
PGVOR = season_ppg – rep_season_ppg

4. Window SPAR (for waivers & trades)

For any window (e.g., after Week 8):

window_spar = window_points – (rep_window_ppg × window_games_started)

Why SPAR?

Incorporates volume (total points)

Incorporates usage (games started)

Incorporates replacement (scarcity)

Scales to auction/snake/waivers/trades without distortion

0.3 Cost Normalization Across League Types
Draft Cost Normalization

Auction:
draft_cost_norm = $$ spent

Snake:
Convert overall_pick → “auction-equivalent dollars” using a pick-value curve.
(The curve can be exponential, historical, or static. The key is: earlier pick = higher cost.)

Waiver Cost Normalization

FAAB
waiver_cost_norm = FAAB_spent

Priority
Convert priority P in an N-team league to cost:

waiver_cost_norm = N + 1 – P


(Or a calibrated mapping. Top priority = highest cost.)

Free
waiver_cost_norm = 0 but may use 0.1 for ROI denominator.

1. DRAFT METRICS LOGIC

Enrichment is based on:

Player’s full-season performance

Player’s cost (auction dollars or pick-equivalent dollars)

Replacement-level value

Position scarcity automatically included via replacement-level

1.1 Core Draft Metrics
1. Season SPAR (Value Over Replacement for full year)
draft_vor = season_spar


This is the ground truth draft value.

2. Draft ROI (Return on Investment)

Measures how much value you got per dollar/pick spent.

General formula:

draft_roi = draft_vor / draft_cost_norm


Interpretation:

1 means great value

~0 means replacement-level return

<0 means bust

3. Points Per Cost

Raw efficiency:

points_per_cost = season_points / draft_cost_norm

4. Rank Delta (if pre-draft expectations available)
draft_pos_rank_delta = expected_pos_rank – actual_pos_rank


Positive = outperforming expectation.

If you don’t have ADP, ignore this.

5. Draft Round Efficiency

For snake or auction:

round_vor = mean(draft_vor per round)
round_roi = mean(draft_roi per round)


This gives insight for charts like “Round 8 produces more value than Round 3.”

1.2 Draft Metric Interpretation

Auction steals → high VOR + cost_norm small → massive ROI

Snake steals → outperforming cost-equivalent pick dollars

Busts → negative SPAR

High-cost but elite → low ROI but high SPAR (valuable but expensive)

Low-cost breakouts → high ROI (fan favorites)

2. WAIVER / FREE AGENT METRICS LOGIC

Waiver moves should measure value received AFTER the acquisition.

This is the biggest difference from draft metrics.

2.1 Define the three evaluation windows

For a transaction at week W:

Immediate Week Value
Points scored in Week W.

Short-Term Window (e.g., next 4 weeks)

4wk_points
4wk_spar


Rest of Season Window (W+1 → playoffs)
This is your main metric:

fa_points_ros = sum(points after W)
fa_spar_ros = sum(points after W) – rep_ppg_over_remaining_weeks × games_started_after_W
fa_ppg_ros = fa_points_ros / games_started_after_W


Replacement level must be computed only on the same remaining weeks.

2.2 Waiver Cost Models
FAAB
waiver_cost_norm = FAAB_spent

Priority
waiver_cost_norm = N + 1 – priority

Free

Use:

either waiver_cost_norm = 0, ROI = None

or 0.1 to keep ROI finite

2.3 Waiver Value Metrics
1. FA Value (Rest-of-Season SPAR)
fa_vor = fa_spar_ros

2. FA ROI
fa_roi = fa_vor / waiver_cost_norm

3. FA Short-Term ROI

(Especially useful early season)

fa_4wk_roi = fa_4wk_spar / waiver_cost_norm

4. Efficiency Rating
fa_ppg_ros – rep_ppg_ros


This is the per-game PGVOR after the pickup.

5. Impact Score (Game Utility Metric)
impact_score = fa_spar_ros


Sort your leaderboard by this for “most impactful pickups.”

2.4 Interpretation

Zero-dollar gem? Very high ROI

Late-season pickups score lower total SPAR, but may have high PGVOR

A FA pickup with high PPG but only 2 games → low SPAR but high spike value

Priority-based systems: treat priority as a scarce resource, equivalent to auction dollars

3. TRADE METRICS LOGIC

Trades must measure:
➡️ Value gained after the trade
NOT season totals.

3.1 Define Trade Window

For a trade executed at week W for player i:

trade_points_ros(i) = sum of player i’s points after W
trade_spar_ros(i) = trade_points_ros(i) – rep_remaining_ppg × games_started_after_W(i)


You compute the player’s rest-of-season SPAR independent of the team.

3.2 Per-Team Trade Value

For each trade:

Value Received by Team A
value_received_A = Σ trade_spar_ros(players received by A)

Value Given Away by Team A
value_given_A = Σ trade_spar_ros(players sent away by A)

Net Trade Value
net_trade_spar_A = value_received_A – value_given_A


This is the definitive “Did I win the trade?” metric.

3.3 Trade ROI (Optional)

Only if FAAB or draft picks are included:

trade_roi_A = net_trade_spar_A / cost_norm


Otherwise ignore.

3.4 Trade Balance Score (League View)

Sum both sides:

trade_balance = |net_trade_spar_A – net_trade_spar_B|


Low = fair trade
High = one-sided

3.5 Interpretation

Combines scarcity, usage, and future schedule

Ignores pre-trade performance (correct behavior)

Rewards trades that turned into playoff-carrying performances

Penalizes trading away a player who pops off later

Waivers

➡️ “How much value did this pickup generate after I got him?”
➡️ Use rest-of-season SPAR and FAAB/priority ROI

Trades

➡️ “What value did I gain from the trade from this point forward?”
➡️ Use rest-of-season SPAR per player, summed by team



Fantasy Football Moves Evaluation Metrics

This report outlines a comprehensive set of metrics to quantify the value of fantasy football moves (draft picks, free-agent pickups, trades) using historical data. Metrics are defined at three levels – Player-level, Move-level, and League-level – and include formulas, rationale, and considerations (such as roster settings, scoring format, PPG vs total, and edge cases like one-off performances). We also describe how to adjust for league-specific rules and propose table columns for implementation.

Player-level Metrics

Value Over Replacement (VOR). Measures how much a player’s total points exceed a replacement-level baseline at that position
fantasypros.com
harvardsportsanalysis.org
. Formula:

VOR = Player_Total_Points – Replacement_Level_Points


Replacement_Level_Points is typically taken as the points scored by the lowest-ranked starter at that position in the league (e.g. for 10 teams starting 1 QB each, the 10th-highest QB)
harvardsportsanalysis.org
. VOR identifies “value” relative to what an easily available waiver-wire player would provide
fantasypros.com
. Edge cases: one-game spikes can inflate VOR for part-time players; to mitigate this, one might require a minimum games threshold or use a per-game VOR (below). PPG vs total: VOR is normally computed on season totals (rewarding durability). In mid-season analysis, you can use weekly VOR or a per-game version, but final evaluations should use total points minus season replacement.

Points Above Replacement (PAR). Essentially the same concept as VOR, often computed weekly and summed through the season
harvardsportsanalysis.org
. Formula (weekly):

PAR_week = Player_Week_Points – Replacement_Level_Week_Points  
PAR_season = Σ PAR_week over all games played


For each week, subtract the replacement player’s points (as defined above) from the player’s points
harvardsportsanalysis.org
. The season PAR is the sum of weekly PAR. This captures both consistency and peak games. Edge cases: a late-season add has fewer weeks, so PAR will naturally be lower; one-game wonders can appear valuable on a per-week basis but may not sustain a high season total. PAR essentially equals VOR when summed over a season. PPG vs total: PAR can be viewed as total points above replacement; a per-game PAR can be used mid-season to normalize for games played, but the final metric should use season totals.

Return on Investment (ROI). Assesses points scored relative to acquisition cost. In auctions or FAAB leagues, ROI = (Player_Points / Dollars_Spent). In draft leagues, one can define ROI using draft slot or pick number as “cost”. For example, Draft ROI = Player_Total_Points / Pick_Number (note: early picks have high “cost” so a 1st pick yields a large ROI value). Alternatively, one might invert the cost (ROI = Points * (Teams*Rounds – Pick) or similar) to make intuitive sense. The rationale is to highlight players who out-scored their expected value given how early they were taken or how much was spent on them. Edge cases: since pick number is ordinal, ROI may distort differences among top picks (all high ROI); consider comparing ROI relative to the average of that round. PPG vs total: Use total points for ROI (it measures full-season yield). A player with few games (e.g. injured early) will have lower ROI due to low total, even if his PPG is high.

Move-level Metrics
Draft Pick Metrics

Draft Value Delta (DVD). Measures how a drafted player performed relative to expectations for that pick or round. Formula:

DraftValueDelta = Player_Total_Points – AvgPoints_for_Pick_or_Round


For example, compare the player’s season points to the historical or league-average points for that draft slot (or round). A positive DVD indicates a “steal” (outperformed his draft slot). Without historical data, one can approximate by subtracting the replacement-level or position baseline for that round. Rationale: Identifies which picks yielded above-average performers. Edge cases: ADP-based expectation can help (if available) – e.g. using consensus ADP or pre-draft rankings to estimate expected points, then computing actual minus expected. Late-round RB/WR breakout might score high DVD. If a drafted player underperforms expectations (negative DVD), he is a “bust.” Always compute DVD using the same league’s scoring.

Pick ROI. A variant of ROI for draft: e.g. Draft_ROI = Player_Points / Pick_Number. This treats the draft slot as cost. It highlights picks where the points per slot are highest. Rationale: Directly relates points to pick cost. Formula example:

Draft_ROI = Player_Total_Points ÷ Pick_Number


(A smaller pick_number is a higher “cost”, so high ROI means low pick number and high points.) Edge: Pick 1 often dominates ROI by raw value, so use relative comparisons by round or league. Alternatively define Round Efficiency = (Player_Points – Replacement_Points) / Pick_Number, combining VOR and cost. PPG vs total: Use season totals for final ROI. Mid-season, one might calculate a running ROI to evaluate picks in progress.

Position-Specific Pick Value. Because position scarcity matters, one can compute the player’s VOR or PAR and then normalize by position demand. For example, if a top TE in a 1-TE league has a certain VOR, that VOR is more “valuable” than a WR’s VOR because fewer TEs start. This can be captured by a PositionScarcityFactor = (Replacement_Points_Pos / Replacement_Points_PPR) or similar (see League-level section below). Use this factor to adjust the DVD or ROI for position. (For instance, multiply a TE’s VOR by a scarcity multiplier if TE starters are scarce.)

Free-Agency (Waiver) Metrics

FAAB ROI. For auction-style free-agent acquisitions, ROI = (Player_Points_after_Pickup / FAAB_Spent). This shows points gained per budget dollar. E.g., if you spent 10 FAAB to get a player who scored 100 points after pickup, ROI = 10. A higher ROI means a bargain. Formula:

FAAB_ROI = Points_PostPickup ÷ FAAB_Spent


If FAAB_Spent = 0 (free pickup), treat ROI as effectively infinite or skip ROI (but still compute absolute value metrics). Rationale: Identifies the most efficient use of FAAB. Edge cases: A player picked late in season has fewer games, so may have modest total points; one can normalize by games (points per remaining game) or compare to replacement-level points over those weeks. Also consider that waiver priority (not cash) is an alternative cost; one could treat a top waiver priority use as a “cost” when FAAB is not used.

Points After Acquisition (PAA). Measures how many points a player contributed after joining the team. Formula:

PAA = Σ (Player_Week_Points for weeks ≥ pickup_week) 


Optionally, PAR_after = Σ(Player_Week_Points – Replacement_Level_Week_Points) for weeks after pickup. Rationale: Captures the actual benefit to the manager. In cutthroat leagues, one might count only points when the player was in the starting lineup. Edge cases: Late pickups naturally have lower PAA simply because fewer games remain, so compare them using PPG or PAR per remaining week. Also account for if the player was on another team’s roster early-season (only count from pickup onward, otherwise points would double-count trade signings).

Addition Impact Score. Combine VOR and timing: for example, Impact = (Player_Points – Replacement_Points_for_remaining_weeks). This rewards not just raw points but how much better the player was than a replacement at the time he joined. Useful for comparing pickups across the season. One could also compute Win-Share Added: estimate how many additional “wins” (match-up victories) the pickup contributed, though that requires simulating rosters.

Trade Metrics

Net Trade Value (Team Impact). For each team involved in a trade, compute the net gain in player value. Formula (using VOR or points):

Trade_Value_Change = Σ(VOR_received) – Σ(VOR_given)  


Or using raw points:

Points_Change = Σ(Points_received) – Σ(Points_given).


(If using VOR, each side’s values are measured against the same league replacement baselines.) A positive Trade_Value_Change means the team “won” the trade in hindsight. Rationale: Quantifies who benefited from the exchange. Edge cases: If picks are included in the trade, you can assign an expected value to the pick (e.g. average VOR of players drafted at that slot). If trades happened mid-season, count only points after the trade date for players moving teams (to avoid counting pre-trade performance). PPG vs total: Use season totals post-trade; for fairness, sometimes teams compare per-game or playoff contributions if trade was late.

Acquisition Differential. Another perspective: measure how each team’s total roster value changed after the trade. Compute both teams’ post-trade total VOR (or total points) and compare to pre-trade totals. The difference yields a team-level trade score. This often yields the same result as net VOR but puts it in a team context.

Trade Fairness Index. Calculate the ratio of acquired value to given value. For example, Trade_ROI = Σ(VOR_received) / Σ(VOR_given). A value >1 indicates the team got more value than it gave up. Edge cases: if one side gave up nothing measurable (e.g. a future draft pick counted as 0), handle divide-by-zero by using net difference instead.

Post-Trade ROI. Similar to Draft ROI but for trades: ratio of points or VOR gained to points or VOR lost. Emphasize players’ actual contributions after the swap. This can highlight “championship trades” where a seemingly minor addition yields many points.

League-level Metrics

Round/Overall ROI by Draft Round. Aggregate how picks in each round performed on average. For each round r, compute:

Avg_ROI_r = mean(Player_Points / Pick_Number) for all picks in round r  
Avg_VOR_r = mean(VOR) for all picks in round r  


Or simply average points or PAR by round. Rationale: Identifies rounds with highest value (often mid-to-late rounds yield high ROI per pick). Use league-specific data or aggregate across similar leagues. Edge cases: first and last rounds have fewer picks so metrics may be noisy; better to look at many seasons or multiple leagues.

Positional Scarcity Index. Quantifies how valuable a position is given roster needs. One approach: ratio of replacement-level points across positions. For example, if in a league QB replacement-level is 15 PPG but TE is 6 PPG
harvardsportsanalysis.org
, TE are scarcer (each top TE is worth more above replacement). Formula example:

Scarcity_PosX = Replacement_Points_PosX / Replacement_Points_PosY  


(e.g., Scarcity_QB_vs_TE = 15.5/6.3
harvardsportsanalysis.org
). A higher ratio means position X has more drop-off (scarcity). Use roster settings to compute each position’s replacement (teams × starters). Rationale: Helps adjust VOR or values when comparing players across positions. In a 1-TE league, top TEs score very high VOR; in a 2-TE league with deeper TE supply, that VOR is harder to get. Incorporate this by weighing a player’s VOR by the relative scarcity factor of his position.

ROI or VOR Distribution Statistics. At the league level, report overall metrics like median or percentile ROI, VOR by position, and turnover of each round. For example, calculate “percent of draft value” obtained by each round or position. This provides context (e.g., “RBs in round 2 averaged X VOR, WRs in round 2 averaged Y VOR”). Such summaries help compare moves against league norms.

Cross-League Normalization. When comparing across leagues with different scoring, convert raw metrics to standardized scores. For instance, compute each player’s VOR z-score within its league (subtract league mean VOR, divide by sd), or use percentiles. This makes “best moves” comparable regardless of scoring scale. Example: If League A is high-scoring (e.g. 0.5 PPR), and League B is standard, normalization aligns the value scales.

Adjusting for League Scoring and Roster

Scoring Rules: All metrics must use the league’s actual scoring rules. E.g., in PPR leagues, receptions count, raising RB/WR totals; replacement-level will be higher than in Standard. Since we use each league’s point data, metrics like VOR/ROI inherently incorporate scoring format. Explicitly note the scoring type (PPR, half-PPR, etc.) in analysis tables.

Roster Structure: Define replacement-level using the league’s starting lineup counts. For example, if a league starts 2 RBs and 3 WRs (plus flex), then replacement RB is roughly the (teams×2+ flex_RB_share)th best RB. In practice, use teams×starters_at_pos as the cutoff for replacement
harvardsportsanalysis.org
. If the league has a WR/TE flex, decide how flex affects replacement: for simplicity, compute replacement separately for each primary slot, then allow flex to fill with the next-highest scorers at RB/WR/TE. Always tailor the replacement calculation to the exact roster limits.

Position Depth: When using PAR or VOR, if a league has an uncommon position (e.g. 2 TEs start), adjust replacement accordingly (for 2-TE league, replacement TE is the teams×2th TE instead of teams×1). Metrics that mix positions (e.g. relative value trades) should account for these differences through the scarcity index or by calculating VOR at the correct positional replacement level.

One-Start Players: In some leagues, a player might rarely be started (e.g. an extra QB in 3-QB leagues). If a position has minimal usage, replacement-level might approach zero. In that case, use a sensible floor or simply treat that position’s VOR with caution (it may be very high for the few starters).

Metrics Unique to Move Types

Draft Moves: Include draft_round, draft_pick, ADP (if available), player_position, player_expected_rank, player_actual_points, VOR, DraftValueDelta, Draft_ROI, and Round_Average. For example, a table of draft picks might have columns: Round, Pick, Player, Position, Total_Points, Replacement_Points, VOR, DraftValueDelta, Pick_ROI.

Free-Agent Pickups: Include pickup_week, FAAB_spent, player_position, points_post_pickup, games_played_post_pickup, points_per_game_post, Replacement_points_post, PAR_after, FAAB_ROI. For example: Week, Team, Player, FAAB, Points_After, Replacement_After, PAR_After, ROI.

Trades: Include a trade_id, team_id, player_in, player_out, role (starter/bench), points_after_trade_in, points_after_trade_out, VOR_in, VOR_out, trade_value_change. Columns might be: Trade_ID, Team, Players_Received, Players_Traded, Sum_Points_In, Sum_Points_Out, VOR_In, VOR_Out, Net_VOR_Change.

In summary tables, also include league_id, scoring_type, and roster_configuration as metadata for context and filtering.

Seasonal Evolution of Metrics

In-Season Updates: During the season, metrics should be updated weekly. Use running totals for VOR/PAR, ROI, etc. When evaluating a move mid-season (e.g. a week-8 pickup), only consider games and points up to that point or for the remainder of season, as appropriate. PPG (points per game) versions of metrics can smooth early-season noise: e.g. use projected season points = PPG × 16 as an interim estimate, then compute “projected VOR”. However, be cautious: early in-season replacement levels and averages are unstable, so include enough weeks (e.g. use 4+ games) before trusting these values.

Post-Season Stability: After the season ends, lock in metrics using full-season totals. Replacement levels become final (no more roster changes). All PAA, PAR, ROI, etc. use season totals or totals from acquisition to season end. Historical analysis should use these final values for consistency. At this point, one can also rank moves and trades definitively (e.g. “Top 5 draft steals of 2024” based on final DraftValueDelta).

Handling Late Changes: If players were traded late or picked up in playoffs, one might note a caveat or use a per-game metric because their raw totals are low. For legacy evaluation, it may be fair to compare their per-week impact (e.g. “average PAR per remaining week”).

Suggested Data Table Columns
Column	Description
league_id	League identifier (for multi-league analysis)
season	Season (year)
team_id	Team making the move (for moves) or player’s team (for player stats)
player_id	Unique player identifier
player_name	Player name
position	Player position (QB, RB, etc.)
points_total	Total fantasy points (season or since move)
points_per_game	Points per game (points_total ÷ games_played)
games_played	Games played (season or after move)
replacement_points	Replacement-level points (for pos., season or relevant weeks)
VOR	Value Over Replacement (points_total – replacement_points)
PAR	Points Above Replacement (same as VOR if using total; or weekly sum)
ROI	Return on Investment (e.g. points ÷ cost; cost = pick number or $)
draft_round	Draft round of pick (for draft moves)
draft_pick	Overall draft pick number
expected_points	Expected points for that pick (from ADP or historical average)
faab_spent	FAAB dollars spent (for FA pickups)
pickup_week	Week player was acquired (for FA moves)
trade_id	Unique identifier for each trade
players_in	List of players acquired in trade
players_out	List of players traded away
sum_points_in	Sum of points of players in (after trade)
sum_points_out	Sum of points of players out (after trade)
vor_in	Sum of VOR of players in (after trade)
vor_out	Sum of VOR of players out (after trade)
trade_value_diff	vor_in – vor_out (positive = gain for team)

Each metric above corresponds to one or more of these columns (e.g. VOR, ROI, PAR), so ensure move logs include the raw inputs (points, cost) needed to calculate them.

In dashboards or pipelines, one would compute these metrics as new columns or views based on existing data tables (rosters, player stats, draft picks, trade logs, etc.). For example, a SQL model might join roster moves with weekly scoring to accumulate points_total and then compute VOR = points_total – replacement_points.

These metrics can be implemented in data pipelines and displayed in dashboards. For instance, VOR and ROI can be updated each week, while final post-season stats provide historical rankings. Columns recommended above will capture the necessary inputs (points, costs, roster counts) and outputs (VOR, ROI, etc.) for analysis and UI tables.

Addendum: Enhanced VOR/ROI Metrics

Replacement‐Level Baseline: We define replacement‐level using the full NFL player pool each week. Concretely, let T = number of teams and S = starters at a position per team; then the “last starter” is the N = T·S-th highest NFL scorer at that position each week. We can take the replacement‐level score R<sub>P</sub> for position P as, for example, the average of the NFL’s (T·S)-th and (T·S+1)-th best players (to smooth between the last starter and first bench). In formula form:

For position P, weekly replacement‐score r<sub>P,w</sub> = median{Points of NFL players ranked k = T·S and k+1 at P in week w.

Then season replacement total:

This uses full NFL data (not just rostered players). For example, in a 10-team league starting one QB, T·S=10, so replacement = 10th NFL QB each week. (FantasyPros similarly used the 12th QB for a 12-team league

.) The player’s VOR is then

where Price<sub>i</sub> = auction dollar bid for player i. (In practice one might omit R<sub>P</sub> in numerator if using raw points-per-dollar.) This metric measures how many fantasy points (or VOR points) are “bought” per dollar. Fantasy Football Analytics explicitly adds a “points per dollar (ROI)” column for auction drafts
r-bloggers.com
. For example, if a player projects 200 points and costs $20, then ROI≈10 points/$1. A higher ROI means better value for the money. (One can also adjust for positional scarcity by dividing VOR by price.)

Snake Draft ROI: Snake leagues have no monetary cost, but each draft slot has an implicit value. We convert pick number to a pseudo‐cost. For instance, use historical “pick‐value” charts (The Ringer’s analysis
theringer.com
) or Zola’s “Graph‐a‐Draft” method
fantasyindex.com
 to assign an equivalent auction cost C(N) to each pick N. Then define:

For example, in a 12-team draft Ringer’s chart gives Pick 1 ≈90 points value, Pick 10 ≈50 points

. If your player’s VOR is 45 and he was drafted at pick 10 (worth ~50 pts), his ROI ~0.9. Alternately, use Zola’s idea: snake an entire budget into rounds to get each pick’s “price”
fantasyindex.com
 (e.g. in a 10-team league the 1.01 pick is like $51, 1.10 like $33

). In summary, snake ROI can be computed by treating each pick as a dollar investment via an equivalence chart: higher ROI means a player outperformed the expected value of that slot.

Waiver Pickup Value: For FAAB leagues, apply a similar ROI:

or $\frac{\text{VOR}_i}{\text{FAAB bid}}$. This yields “points per FAAB dollar.” In non-FAAB (priority) leagues, there is no explicit cost, so we use proxies. One approach is to assign an implicit bid based on waiver order: e.g. map priority #1 to an equivalent of $100, #2 to $90, etc., calibrated to historical FAAB bids. Then ROI ≈VOR/(implied bid). Alternatively, express value in “priority‐position efficiency”: a rough index is

where WaiverCost might be the waiver round or (teams+1−priority) as a unit cost. For example, using priority 1 in a 12-team league could be viewed as “spending” 12 waiver‐points. A simpler proxy is to compute expected FAAB for that player (say $X) and treat taking him with priority as saving $X. In practice one often just notes that early-season pickups (week 1–4) have more impact, or compares the player’s VOR to typical adds: e.g. if comparable players go for $30 FAAB, then priority pickup ROI~VOR/30. (No standard formula exists here; one must judge by opportunity cost and league context.)

Cross-Format Normalization: To compare ROI across leagues, convert everything to a common scale. For drafts, this means translating snake picks to auction dollars (or vice versa). As noted, one can snake a total budget through all picks
fantasyindex.com
. For waivers, align priority to FAAB-dollars. For example, if you assign an implicit $ value to each waiver round (analogous to pick value), then ROI<sub>S</sub> and ROI<sub>A</sub> are directly comparable. In effect, all ROI measures become “points per dollar” on the same budget scale. By anchoring replacement‐level to true NFL production and scaling costs consistently (e.g. using pick‐value curves
theringer.com
 or snaking methods
fantasyindex.com
), we can unify ROI from auctions, drafts, and waivers into one framework. This lets us say, for instance, “Player A’s VOR per $ spent in auction is X, which is higher/lower than Player B’s VOR per pick-cost in a snake” — making strategies across formats commensurate.
